# Visualizing Government Debt
## Part 1: Government Debt Chart
The barplot below shows the government debt-to-GDP ratio in the year 2019.

## Part 2: Grid of Line Charts
Here is a grid of line charts that I created in Flourish Studio with the data provided by OECD. This collection of line plots show the debt-to-GDP ratio (gross debt of the general government as a percentage of GDP) for each OECD country. The data here is from 1995 to 2019, but for some countries, the data is missing. If you hover over the lines, you will be able to see the exact ratio value for each year. The last two graphs (OAVG and OECD) show the values for OECD average and OECD total, respectively.

## Part 3: Slope Chart
After COVID-19 hit, government debt has increased substantially across the globe ([Source](https://www.imf.org/en/Blogs/Articles/2021/12/15/blog-global-debt-reaches-a-record-226-trillion)), so I thought it would be interesting to see the change in government debt between 2019 and 2020 using the above data. Here is a slope chart that shows us the percent change in debt-to-GDP ratio from 2019 to 2020 in G20 countries. As expected, there was an increase in debt-to-GDP ratio between 2019 and 2020 for all countries. Slope charts are similar to line charts in that they depict temporal data and show how values have changed over time. However, they are unique in that users can compare the *rate of change* between different countries. Additionally, slope charts use straight lines, which simplifies the visualization and makes it easy to interpret the idea at a glance. In this chart, I've used a step curve to visualize the magnitude of change. For the color scheme, red indicates greatest increase, orange indicates moderate increase, and green indicates mild increase.
