## Outline
TeleMedicine has become a useful tool for healthcare providers to deliver healthcare to patients, especially after the pandemic. Benefits of telemedicine include improved access to care, convenience, and slowing spread of disease. However, with the rise of utilization, we have also consequently seen the disparities of utilization across different sociodemographic and geographic characteristics. The aim of this project is to inform the audience of the existing disparities with telemedicine utilization and in response, provide an example of successful interventions of reducing these barriers. The intended audience for this project is primarily healthcare providers and healthcare operations, but patients can also be part of the audience.
