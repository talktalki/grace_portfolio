## Outline
TeleMedicine has become a useful tool for healthcare providers to deliver healthcare to patients, especially after the pandemic. Benefits of telemedicine include improved access to care, convenience, and slowing spread of disease. However, with the rise of utilization, we have also consequently seen the disparities of utilization across different sociodemographic and geographic characteristics. The aim of this project is to inform the audience of the existing disparities with telemedicine utilization and in response, provide an example of successful interventions of reducing these barriers. The intended audience for this project is primarily healthcare providers and healthcare operations, but patients can also be part of the audience.

**Project structure**
- Story Arc
![Story Arc](story_arc.jpg)
- One-line summary: TeleMedicine is a useful tool, but *not* to everyone.
- User story: As a reader, I want to understand the disparities in telemedicine utilization so that I can make this tool a universal one.
- Call to action: I can do this by employing interventions to reduce disparities at my facility.

## Dataset
| Name | URL | Description |
|------|-----|-------------|
| NCHS-NHIS  | National Center for Health Statistics is a nationally representative household survey of the US population. National Health Interview Surveys (NHIS) are conducted yearly, and typically conducted in respondents’ homes or over the telephone. This dataset provides trends in use of telemedicine in the recent years (2019-2023). This can inform the readers of the impactful role of telemedicine during the pandemic. |
| NCHS-NEHRS | National Electronic Health Record Survey collects information on both office-based physicians’ adoption and use of electronic health record (EHR) systems. 
| US Census Bureau | Household Pulse Survey (COVID-19) is designed to collect data on how people’s lives have been impacted by the covid-19 pandemic. Specifically, it gives us information on how access to and use of video-enabled vs. audio-only telehealth services differ across patient populations (by race, ethnicity, income, age, and insurance status). The data was collected over the periods April 2021 through August 2022. |
