# Wireframes / storyboards
I started building a wireframe of my narrative on Shorthand - here is the [link](https://preview.shorthand.com/94X5Be119IxcWNJm).

# User research 
There are two aim of this user research: 
(1) to assess whether the narrative is a compelling and interesting story, 
(2) to assess the impact and relevance of the data visualizations incorporated in the narrative.

## Target audience
My intended target audience for this narrative is: heathcare providers (specifically in the rural areas in the US). I hope to raise the issue of disparities in telehealth usage for the elderly in the rural regions and suggest employing interventions to reduce disparities at their facilities.

## Interview script

| Questions to Ask | Goal |
|------------------|------|
|1. What do you think the message of this is?         | To assess if user can understand the overarching message/theme |
|2. What did you find most interesting or well done?  | To identify areas that were solid/strong |
|3. What did you find unclear or confusing?           | To identify any graphs or ideas that were unclear/hard to understand and perform revisions |
|4. What would you do differently?                    | To identify areas of improvement |
|5. What would you add or incorporate to this story?  | To identify new ideas that could further the message |

## Interview findings

| Questions               | Interview 1  <br> 27-yo male, 3rd year medical student, has experience in health IT work | Interview 2 <br> 22-yo female, college student, computer science major | Interview 3 <br> 25-yo male, content creator|
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|-------------|
| 1. What do you think the message is? | The message is that telehealth, because of its increase in usage, has left people behind in the quality of care. Specific narrative is focused on: elderly in rural areas. | The message is that telehealth is not easy to use for everyone because of issues like limited access, difficulty in using the tool. There are ways to combat these difficulties. | The message is that we need to do better in providing telehealth access for people that don't have access (65+ in rural areas). | 
| 2. What did you find most interesting? | The narrative was built upon graph after graph - it's solid. I found the graphs on the broadband usage most clear and straightforward. The successful case was interesting - but maybe expound on it a little more so it connects back to telehealth services? | I found the parking lot practice interesting - new call to action.| I found the call to action interesting, but wouldn't the parking lot practice defeat the purpose of improving access for the rural population? It would be difficult for people to travel in rural areas? On the other hand, I can see how utilizing business partnerships can improve acces - if the location is in the individual's everyday routine, it wouldn't be a hassle to reach there. | 
| 3. What did you find unclear or confusing? | 1-Remove tangents from the narrative. (i.e. reimbursement issue in the bar graph) It took my attention away and it doesn't relate to your overall narrative. Maybe you could design another visual to highlight the issue of limited access to connectivity - currently it's not that obvious. <br> 2-I'm confused with the parking lot practice. The irony of having to travel - it's one solution but not applicable to every situation. | Some of the graphs I wasn't sure due to unclear axes, and more explanation for each graph would help. | Too many graphs..? It's a little overwhelming. The slope chart is confusing - who is answering this question? Is it the patient or the provider? |
| 4. What would you do differently? | 1-Use more direct language: "You as a healthcare provider..." <br> 2-The wrap up feels too sudden. Maybe if you introduce some of the solutions differently.. you wouldn't need to necessarily have a "wrap-up". You can just end with the call to actions that makes it relevant to the problem that you introduced. <br> 3-Include photos that are more relevant to the narrative. | I understand the problem and good elaboration with the issues of the problem, but I would need more elaboration to the solution/call to action. My least favorite graph is the bar graph that illustrates issues because it's not visually appealing.. it's ugly. | Nothing |
| 5. What would you add or incorporate to this story? | 1. I would clean up the last bit. I like the successful case but it seems to not really connect with the overall problem. For example, think about what rural healthcare providers can do with existing resources (libraries, schools, other facilities - think about public resources) <br> 2. Specify that Wilson is a rural city so that it is more straightforward to the user. | 1. I would add more interaction with the story (a quiz question that you could incorporate to elicit engagement from the users. <br> 2. It would help if you could add the implications for this - i.e. add how impactful this can be for the providers. | I would add a personal story to make it more tangible and interesting - i.e. old individual that went through the struggle. |

# Identified changes for Part III

| Research synthesis                       | Anticipated changes for Part III                                                |
|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1. Modify the call to action (be more specific) | There were a lot of feedback on the call to action - mostly that they were interesting, but also wondering if it will actually work in the rural setting. I will either remove the parking lot practice action or edit it so that users may know there is a caveat with this option. |
| 2. Be more direct with the call to action to the audience | I will utilize the language "You as a healthcare provider...". |
| 3. Add a personal story (hook) or an interactive feature for audience engagement | As an intro, I will add in a short personal story to capture the audience initially to the narrative. |
| 4. Add the implication of the call to action (optional) | This was a good suggestion - it could be an additional factor I can add at the end, after the call to action, to show the potential impact of improving access. |
| 5. Remove tangents from the narrative | The bar graph illustrating issues with telehealth usage doesn't effectively highlight the core issue I want to focus on. I will reduce the graph so that light is shed on the core issue. |
| 6. Work on improving the graphs | I will specify the axes (especially the age graph), add short explanations of the main point of each graph, for the slope chart, specify who the survey respondents were, etc. |
| 7. Include photos that are more relevant to the narrative. | I will add in/change photos to be more consistent with the overall narrative - focus on the theme of rural, elderly, spotty connection, etc.  |
