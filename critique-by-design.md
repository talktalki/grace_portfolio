# Critique By Design

## Original Data Visualization
![Original Visualization](study-in-the-US.png)
- Source: https://www.affordablecollegesonline.org/international-students-guide-studying-in-usa/

## Critique
- A lot of colors. Between the pie chart and the table, the author indicated the matching color from the pie chart on the left side of the table, but because there are too many colors, it’s difficult to keep track which color indicates which country.
- 3d pie charts. This type of visualization is not recommended as it can distort the size of the area in the pieces, and therefore wrongly represent the values of each piece. For instance, 31% in red looks much bigger than 30.9% in blue, even though it’s only 0.1% difference.
- Lack of key message. I think the author could do a little better to further develop the key message of the visualization. Right now, the visualization shows the top 10 countries in the world with most international students in the US, but it ends there. It would be better if there was a specific key message that the visualization targeted for the audience. For example, the visualization could tell a story about how the numbers changed for each country before and after the pandemic. (Key message: the number of foreign students studying in the United States fell sharply during the 2020/21 academic year) I would also update the data to represent the most relevant academic years as of now.
