# About me
Hi! I am a second-year masters student in the HCA program at CMU. Before moving to Pittsburgh, I lived in Chicago, which is a beautiful city. I aspire to do analytical work in the healthcare industry, specifically with real world data, which includes health claims data and patient records. I want to practice making creative, intuitive data visualizations in order to communicate better!

# What I hope to learn
1. How to create narratives
2. How to effectively use colors
3. New tools to perform visualizations

# Portfolio
Here's a list of what I will work on over the next few weeks.

## Assignment 1: [Visualizing Government Debt](visualizing-government-debt)
In this exercise, I get to delve into creating data visualization using online tools. I'll be using a web-based visualization tool initially, and then I'll be creating two of my own visualizations using Flourish.

## Assignment 2: [Critique by Design](critique-by-design)
This assignment takes me through a five-step process to critique and recreate a data visualization. In step one, I searched for a data visualization that could be improved, ensuring I have access to the data. Then, I critiqued the visualization and sketched out a solution, considering both the redesign and the context of its presentation. I shared my sketches with two other individuals for feedback, and then utilized this feedback to modify my design and create a new data visualization.

## Final project
[Part I](final-project-part-one) | [Part II](final-project-part-two) | [Part III](final-project-part-three) <br>
My culminating project tells the narrative: telehealth, despite its transformative potential, remains an elusive resource for the elderly residing in rural regions. I started out with extensive research, then gathered publicly accessible data, and created sketches to underscore insightful aspects of this issue. Then, I conducted a series of interviews, in order to garner insightful feedback. Based on the feedback, I used Flourish to craft a series of visualizations and lastly, used the Shorthand platform to create a user-friendly website to convey this narrative effectively.
