# About me
Hi! I am a second-year masters student in the HCA program at CMU. I aspire to do analytical work in the healthcare industry, specifically with real world data, which includes health claims data and patient records. I want to practice making creative, intuitive data visualizations in order to communicate better!

# What I hope to learn
1. How to create narratives
2. How to effectively use colors
3. New tools to perform visualizations
