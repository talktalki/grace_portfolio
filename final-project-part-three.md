# The final data story
[Telehealth, is it for everyone?](https://preview.shorthand.com/94X5Be119IxcWNJm).

# Changes made since Part II
In response to feedback received, several key modifications have been made to the narrative. First, the call to action has been refined to be more specific, addressing concerns about its effectiveness in rural settings. Secondly, the call to action is now more direct, addressing the audience as "healthcare providers." To enhance engagement, a personal dialogue between an elderly patient and a healthcare provider has been added in the introduction to captivate the audience. This will help the narrative be more personal and relatable. Finally, tangential elements, such as the issue concerning insurance issues in the bar graph, have been removed to focus on the core issue of the narrative.

## The audience
> Talk about who you identified as the audience for your final data story.  Include any other information you've used that helped you narrow the focus (e.g. insights from your interviews, personas, etc.).  Note any specific adjustments you made to your final project to make it work for your audience.

My intended target audience for this narrative is: heathcare providers, specifically those serving patients in rural areas of the United States. I hope to raise the issue of disparities in telehealth usage for the elderly in the rural regions. My call to action focuses how healthcare providers can employ interventions that can be implemented at their facilities. I suggest these interventions so that they can ultimately reduce disparities and combat barriers, leading to more equitable and effective healthcare delivery in rural settings.
