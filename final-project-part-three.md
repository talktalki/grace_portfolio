# Changes made since Part II

| Research synthesis                       | Anticipated changes for Part III                                                |
|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1. Modify the call to action (be more specific) | There were a lot of feedback on the call to action - mostly that they were interesting, but also wondering if it will actually work in the rural setting. I will either remove the parking lot practice action or edit it so that users may know there is a caveat with this option. |
| 2. Be more direct with the call to action to the audience | I will utilize the language "You as a healthcare provider...". |
| 3. Add a personal story (hook) or an interactive feature for audience engagement | As an intro, I will add in a short personal story to capture the audience initially to the narrative. |
| 4. Add the implication of the call to action (optional) | This was a good suggestion - it could be an additional factor I can add at the end, after the call to action, to show the potential impact of improving access. |
| 5. Remove tangents from the narrative | The bar graph illustrating issues with telehealth usage doesn't effectively highlight the core issue I want to focus on. I will reduce the graph so that light is shed on the core issue. |

## The audience
> Talk about who you identified as the audience for your final data story.  Include any other information you've used that helped you narrow the focus (e.g. insights from your interviews, personas, etc.).  Note any specific adjustments you made to your final project to make it work for your audience.

My intended target audience for this narrative is: heathcare providers (specifically in the rural areas in the US). I hope to raise the issue of disparities in telehealth usage for the elderly in the rural regions and suggest employing interventions to reduce disparities at their facilities.

## Final design decisions
> You can specifically break out your design decisions here, or include it under *Changes made since Part II* and delete this section. Talk about the design decisions you had to make along the way, and reflect on anything in particular that stands out to you that you learned working through the process.  Include any other information that helps round out your data story.
