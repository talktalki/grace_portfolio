# The final data story
[Telehealth, is it for everyone?](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/telehealth-is-it-for-everyone/index.html)

# Changes made since Part II
In response to feedback received, several key modifications have been made to the narrative. These modifications can be divided into two parts: content and design. 
Regarding content, the call to action has been refined to be more specific, addressing concerns about its effectiveness in rural settings. Secondly, the call to action is now more direct, addressing the audience as "healthcare providers." Finally, I removed any element that was irrelvant to the narrative, such as any reason that was irrelevant to the idea of internet access.
For design purposes, I added a personal dialogue between an elderly patient and a healthcare provider in the introduction to captivate the audience. This will help the narrative be more personal and relatable to the audience.

## The audience
My intended target audience for this narrative is: heathcare providers, specifically those serving patients in rural areas of the United States. I hope to raise the issue of disparities in telehealth usage for the elderly in the rural regions. Before I present my call to action, I specifically address the healthcare providers and ask what they might be able to do to improve access for their elderly patients. My call to action focuses how providers can employ interventions that can be implemented at their facilities. I suggest interventions that are practical and feasible so that they can combat barriers in their workplace, ultimately leading to more equitable and effective healthcare delivery in rural settings.

# Final thoughts
Surprisingly, it took me alot of time to search for relevant data sources and then to clean the data before creating the visualizations. It was essential to have a well-defined narrative/message in mind prior to data cleaning, so that I searched for and cleaned data with a clear purpose. The story served as a guideline to my search process and decide on what to keep and what to leave out. However, at the same time, I felt like I was stuck to one course of narrative, which hindered me from being flexible with creating alternative narratives. Consequently, I came to realize the importance of reaching a balance between following a focused narrative and remaining open to the flexibility of exploring alternative narratives.
